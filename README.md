# Authentication-Web-Page
This is a web-page which will be allow you to login with proper credentials.

I have implemented all leveles of security as saved by various commits.

1- Level-1 Security Is just the mongoose security where we verify the username and password of the user whose data is stored in our database.

2- Level-2 Security is by adding by encypting password by using md5 npm package .

3- Level-3 Security is added by hashing the password by using bcrypt npm package.

4- Level-4 Security is done by hashing and salting more more security of the password field .

5- Level-5 Security is done by adding cokkies and sessions to our web-page by using passportjs .

6- Level-6 Security is added by using google authorization method that was included in our app.js 

by using this the authentication is done by google .
